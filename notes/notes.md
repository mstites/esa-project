## Calibration
1. Place robot flat on ground
2. Load code
3. Monitor serial monitor
4. Hold robot upright in the air as if it were balancing
5. Record the value on the screen - this value corresponds to a constant offset of the angle measurement (this value will be subtracted out of angle measurement in actual code by replacing the 0.25)

## Natural frequency
1. Remove wheels
2. Place robot on ground
3. Load code
4. Hold robot by axles
